# Future Improvements

## Tab Functionality
- [ ] **Tab State Restoration**: Implement functionality to restore tabs and their state (URL, history, etc.) when the app is restarted.
- [ ] **Drag to New Window**: Allow dragging a tab outside the window to create a new window instance.
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Optimize memory usage when many tabs are open (e.g., unload background tabs if necessary, though this conflicts with the requirement to keep them running).
