# User Guide

## Overview

The Stringer Driver App is a tool designed to automate interactions with the MLB Stringer web application. It wraps the web app in a desktop frame and provides sidebar controls for common tasks.

## Getting Started

1. Launch the application.
2. Log in to the Stringer web application in the main view. Your session will be persisted for future launches.

## Features

### Initial Setup
Click the **Initial Setup** button in the sidebar to run the pre-game configuration sequence.
*Note: Ensure you are on the home screen before running this.*

### Advance Game
Click the **Advance Game** button to proceed through the game flow (e.g., next play, next inning).

## Troubleshooting

- **Automation fails**: If an automation script stops working, the web application structure might have changed. Check the logs or contact a developer to update the selectors.
- **Login issues**: If you are unable to log in, try restarting the application to refresh the session.
